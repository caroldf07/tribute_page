            <p>Born in Chicago in 1901, <strong>Disney</strong> developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as <strong>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942)</strong>, furthered the development of animated film.<br><br> New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful <strong>Cinderella (1950) and Mary Poppins (1964)</strong>, the latter of which received five Academy Awards.<br><br>Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his namesake studio and company maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.</p>

            <h2>WORK</h2>
            <p>To replace <strong>Oswald</strong>, Disney and Iwerks developed <strong>Mickey Mouse</strong>, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are unclear.Disney's original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but Lillian thought it too pompous, and suggested <strong>Mickey</strong> instead.Iwerks revised Disney's provisional sketches to make the character easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself from the animation process, provided Mickey's voice until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, "Ub designed Mickey's physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul." A cartoon mouse is operating a ship's steering wheelThe first appearance of Mickey Mouse, in Steamboat Willie (1928).<br><br><strong>Mickey Mouse</strong> first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short Plane Crazy, but it, and the second feature, The Gallopin' Gaucho, failed to find a distributor. Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz Singer, Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat Willie, to create the first post-produced sound cartoon. After the animation was complete, Disney signed a contract with the former executive of <strong>Universal Pictures</strong>, Pat Powers, to use the "Powers Cinephone" recording system; Cinephone became the new distributor for Disney's early sound cartoons, which soon became popular.</p>

            <h2>DEATH</h2>
            <p>Disney had been a <strong>heavy smoker</strong> since <strong>World War I</strong>. He did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man. In November 1966, he was diagnosed with <strong>lung cancer</strong> and was treated with cobalt therapy. On November 30 he felt unwell and was taken to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, ten days after his 65th birthday, he died of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer. Disney's remains were cremated two days later and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.</p>
